abstract = {The maximum power of Feynman's ratchet as a heat engine and the corresponding efficiency ($\eta$*) are investigated by optimizing both the internal parameter and the external load. When a perfect ratchet device (no heat exchange between the ratchet and the pawl via kinetic energy) works between two thermal baths at temperatures T1 {\textgreater} T2, its efficiency at maximum power is found to be $\eta$* = $\eta$2C/[$\eta$C - (1 - $\eta$C)ln(1 - $\eta$C)], where $\eta$C ≡ 1 - T2/T1. This efficiency is slightly higher than the value obtained by Curzon and Ahlborn (1975 Am. J. Phys. 43 22) for macroscopic heat engines. It is also slightly larger than the result $\eta$SS ≡ 2$\eta$C/(4 - $\eta$C) obtained by Schmiedl and Seifert (2008 EPL 81 20003) for stochastic heat engines working at small temperature differences, while the evident deviation between $\eta$* and $\eta$SS appears at large temperature differences. For an imperfect ratchet device in which the heat exchange between the ratchet and the pawl via kinetic energy is non-vanishing, the efficiency at maximum power decreases with increase in the heat conductivity. {\textcopyright} 2008 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

An important technological goal is thus the design of maximally efficient engines working at the maximum possible power. We show that, by utilising shortcuts to adiabaticity in a quantum engine cycle, one can engineer a thermodynamic cycle working at finite power and zero friction.

abstract = {Under a general framework, shortcuts to adiabatic processes are shown to be possible in classical systems. We study the distribution function of the work done on a small system initially prepared at thermal equilibrium. We find that the work fluctuations can be significantly reduced via shortcuts to adiabatic processes. For example, in the classical case, probabilities of having very large or almost zero work values are suppressed. In the quantum case, negative work may be totally removed from the otherwise non-positive-definite work values. We also apply our findings to a micro Otto-cycle-based heat engine. It is shown that the use of shortcuts, which directly enhances the engine output power, can also increase the heat-engine efficiency substantially, in both quantum and classical regimes. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Physical Society.},

@article{Li2016,
abstract = {In conventional thermodynamics, it is widely acknowledged that the realization of an isothermal process for a system requires a quasistatic controlling protocol. Here we propose and design a strategy to realize a finite-rate isothermal transition from an equilibrium state to another one at the same temperature, which is named the "shortcut to isothermality." By using shortcuts to isothermality, we derive three nonequilibrium work relations, including an identity between the free-energy difference and the mean work due to the potential of the original system, a Jarzynski-like equality, and the inverse relationship between the dissipated work and the total driving time. We numerically test these three relations by considering the motion of a Brownian particle trapped in a harmonic potential and dragged by a time-dependent force.},

The general theory is illustrated by spins driven by changing magnetic fields, and implies that any spin expectation history, including those where the spin never precesses, can be generated by infinitely many driving fields, here displayed explicitly. Asymptotically, the absence of transitions is explained by continuation to complex time, where the complex degeneracies in the transitionless driving fields have a nongeneric structure for which there is no Stokes phenomenon; this is analogous to the explanation of reflectionless potentials. {\textcopyright} 2009 IOP Publishing Ltd.},
